      <h3>6. Delivery of Perishable Products</h3>
      <p>
        As EMCD deals with fresh dairy products, we ensure that all perishable
        items are carefully packaged and shipped under controlled conditions to
        maintain their freshness. However, please keep in mind the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Perishable items such as milk, yogurt, and other dairy products may
          have a shorter shelf life. Therefore, it is important to ensure that
          someone is available to receive the package promptly upon delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          We recommend storing perishable items in a refrigerator immediately
          upon receipt to maintain their quality and safety.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Order Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an email containing
        your tracking number and details about the carrier used for delivery.
        You can use this tracking number to monitor the progress of your
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about your order or need assistance with
        tracking, please contact our customer support team.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Failed Deliveries and Return to Sender</h3>
      <p>
        If the delivery attempt fails due to incorrect address information or if
        the package is not collected in a timely manner, the carrier may return
        the package to EMCD. In such cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Address Verification:</strong> If the shipping address
          provided was incorrect, the customer is responsible for providing the
          correct address and covering any additional shipping charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Return to Sender:</strong> If a package is returned to EMCD
          due to failed delivery attempts, we will notify you. Reshipping
          charges will apply if you wish to have the product resent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9. Damaged or Missing Items</h3>
      <p>
        We take great care in packaging your order to ensure it reaches you in
        perfect condition. However, in the rare event that your order arrives
        damaged or items are missing, please contact us within 1 days of
        receiving the delivery with the following details:

      </p>

      <h3>10. Shipping Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        There may be certain restrictions on shipping certain items due to their
        nature, such as perishable dairy products, hazardous materials, or items
        with limited shelf life. EMCD reserves the right to refuse to ship to
        certain regions or cancel an order if the product cannot be shipped
        safely.
      </p>
